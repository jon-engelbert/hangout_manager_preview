    When a user adds himself to the queue, then a new row is added to the table, 
    and the fields for project description and Available Until will be editable. 
    So the user can set the project description and Time Range fields, similar to adding a new comment into slack or Disqus.  
    
    When Initiating a new Hangout, perhaps there can be a checkbox for the pair to mark the session as open or closed.
    For a row representing the user's active hangout,i.e. the user is a participant, show the 'Manage Hangout" link.
